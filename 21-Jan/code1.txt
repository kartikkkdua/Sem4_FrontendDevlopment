Bootstrap loading to design responsive websites with consistent and functional user interfaces.
In Bootstrap we use the given elements and load them in the websites so as we can save our time
and we can get the elements.
Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework used for designing and developing responsive and mobile-first
websites and web applications. It provides pre-designed components, utilities, and a responsive
grid system that makes it easier for developers to create consistent and visually appealing layouts
without needing to write all the CSS from scratch.

Key Features of Bootstrap:
Responsive Design:
Includes a flexible grid system (based on 12 columns) that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring
your website looks good on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Pre-designed Components:
Provides a variety of UI components such as buttons, navigation bars, modals, forms, carousels, cards,
 and more, which can be easily customized.
Utility Classes:
Offers a set of utility classes for common tasks like margin, padding, alignment, colors, and visibility,
 reducing the need to write custom CSS.
Mobile-first Approach:
Bootstrap follows a mobile-first philosophy, meaning designs are optimized for smaller screens by 
default and scale up for larger screens.
Customization:
Developers can customize Bootstrap's default styles using Sass variables, mixins, and custom themes.
JavaScript Components:
Includes built-in JavaScript-based interactive components like modals, tooltips, popovers, dropdowns,
 and collapsibles, which enhance user interaction.
